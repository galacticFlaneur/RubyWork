# SKELETON

This is a Ruby project skeleton with RSpec for testing. It's inspired by [Learn
Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex46.html).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/orenyk/SKELETON.git
   project_name`)
2. Move into the directory (`cd project_name`)
3. Set up Git for yourself:
  1. Simply fork it (`git remote set-url origin git@github.com/USERNAME/REPO`), OR
  2. Remove the current `.git/` directory and start fresh:

     ```
rm -r .git/
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com/USERNAME/REPO
     ```
4. Edit the placeholder stuff
  * rename `NAME.gemspec` and edit it with the correct information
  * rename the `lib/NAME/` directory and `lib/NAME.rb` file
  * rename the default spec file (`spec/lib/NAME_spec.rb`) and edit the
    `require` at the top
  * edit the README

## Disclaimer
This is extremely basic and also effectively untested, use at your own risk.
